    "In order to install the RingerProject packages, it is needed to compile the source codes and prepare the environment to the next usage setups. All RingerProject tools are available on CVMFS, however, it is possible to compile the packages without access to CVMFS as described in the ahead topics. Basically, the following tools need to be available on the OS if no CVMFS is available (in most cases, CVMFS access is only available to CERN computers):\n",
    "\n",
    "- CERN root framework: choose one recent stable release;\n",
    "- python2: make sure to have at least one recent 2.7 python available;\n",
    "- C compiler (clang/gcc): make sure to have one recent C++ compiler;\n",
    "- git/subversion: The git provides an easy way to obtain the packages and keep the release update. The subversion is a dependency for RootCore and therefore it is needed by the release.\n",
    "\n",

The last release available during when this documentation was written is [6.06](https://root.cern.ch/download/root_v6.06.02.Linux-ubuntu14-x86_64-gcc4.8.tar.gz).
